Kata's:
There is a list of them at:
    http://codekata.com/
as well.  Some of there are from there, though they may be renamed.


 1) FizzBuzz
 2) StringCalculator
 3) binary indexOf {
     Write a binary indexOf method that takes an integer search target
     and a sorted array of integers. It should return the integer index
     of the target in the array, or -1 if the target is not in the array.
     The signature will logically be:
        indexOf(int, array_of_int)  -> int

     You can assume that the array has less than 100,000 elements.
     For the purposes of this Kata, time and memory performance are not
     issues (assuming the chop terminates before you get bored and kill it,
     and that you have enough RAM to run it).
 }
 4) Namespace storage
